## Introduction

`HVML` is a descriptive programming language proposed and designed by [Vincent Wei],
    who is the author of [MiniGUI], one of the earliest open-source software projects in China.

`PurC` is the acronym of `the Prime HVML inteRpreter for C/C++ language`.
It is also the abbreviation of `Purring Cat`,
   while `Purring Cat` is the nickname and the mascot of HVML.

The goal of PurC is to implement all features defined by [HVML Specification V1.0]
and all predefined dynamic objects defined by [HVML Predefined Variables V1.0] in C language.

You can use PurC to run an HVML program or an HVML app by using the command line tool `purc`,
    or use PurC as a library to build your own HVML interpreter.

We release the PurC library under LGPLv3, so it is free for commercial use if you follow the conditions and terms of LGPLv3.

This is version 0.9.22 of PurC.
By now, PurC provides support for Linux and macOS.
The support for Windows is on the way.
We welcome anyone to port PurC to other platforms.

## Building PurC

Note that, if you are seeking the pre-built packages for platforms such as Ubuntu, Deepin, Homebrew, and MSYS2, you can refer to the following page:

<https://hvml.fmsoft.cn/software>

### Prerequisites

To build PurC from source code, please make sure that the following tools or libraries are available on your Linux or macOS system:

1. The cross-platform build system generator: CMake 3.15 or later
1. A C11 and CXX17 compliant compiler: GCC 8+ or Clang 6+
1. Zlib 1.2.0 or later
1. Glib 2.44.0 or later
1. BISON 3.0 or later
1. FLEX 2.6.4 or later
1. Python 3 (Python 3.9.0 or later if you want to build the external dynamic variant object `$PY` to use Python in HVML).
1. Ncurses 5.0 or later (optional; needed by Foil renderer in `purc`)
1. SQLite3 3.10.0 or later (optional)

If you want to enable the remote data fetcher, the following libraries are needed too:

1. libsoup2 or libsoup3
1. libgcrypt
1. libicu
1. libgpg-error
1. libunistring
1. openssl

If you are using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or other similiar Linux distribution, you can use the following commands to install all above dependencies:

```console
$ sudo apt install gcc-12 g++-12 bison flex python3
$ sudo apt install zlib1g-dev libglib2.0-dev libncurses-dev libbison-dev libpython3-dev libsqlite3-dev

# For remote fetcher:
$ sudo apt install libsoup-3.0-dev libgcrypt20-dev libgpg-error-dev libicu-dev libunistring-dev libssl-dev
```

Although the port for Windows is still on the way, it is possible to build PurC on Windows 10 version 2004 or later:
You can install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and a Linux distribution, e.g., Ubuntu, on your Windows system,
    then build PurC in the Ubuntu environment.

### Building steps

We assume that you are using Linux.

After fetching the source of PurC, you can change to the root of the source tree,
      and use the following command line to build and install PurC:

```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DPORT=Linux -B build && cmake --build build && sudo cmake --install build
```

The above command line consists of the following commands:

1. `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DPORT=Linux -B build`: Change to the `build/`
subdirectory and run `cmake` to generate the building files to build PurC.
Note that this command uses the following options:
   - `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`: Specify the building type as `RelWithDebInfo`.
   You can also use `Debug`, `Release`, and other options supported by `cmake`.
   - `-DPORT=Linux`: Tell `cmake` that you are building PurC for an operating system
   based on the Linux kernel. Use `-DPORT=Mac` if you are using macOS.
   - `-B build`: Generate building files in the `build/` subdirectory.
1. `cmake --build build`: Build PurC in the `build/` subdirectory.
1. `sudo cmake --install build`: Install PurC from the `build/` subdirectory.

You can also use the following commands to build and install PurC step by step:

```bash
$ cd <path/to/the/root/of/the/source/tree/of/PurC>
$ rm -rf build/
$ mkdir build/
$ cd build/
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPORT=Linux ..
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
```

If you'd like to use `clang` `llvm` instead of `make` to build PurC,
   you can use the following commands:

```bash
$ cd <path/to/the/root/of/the/source/tree/of/PurC>
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DPORT=Linux -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -Bbuild -GNinja &&  ninja -Cbuild && sudo ninja -Cbuild install
```

If you'd like to use `ninja` instead of `make` to build PurC,
   you can use the following commands:

```bash
$ cd <path/to/the/root/of/the/source/tree/of/PurC>
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DPORT=Linux -Bbuild -GNinja &&  ninja -Cbuild && sudo ninja -Cbuild install
```

Note that you might need to remove the `build/` directory first if there is already one.

By default, the above commands will build PurC and install the headers, libraries, executables,
   and some documents to your system (under the `/usr/local/` directory if you are using a Linux system).

When using `make`, you can use `DESTDIR` to specify an alternative installation directory:

```bash
$ make DESTDIR=/package/stage install
```

When using `ninja`, you can also use `DESTDIR` to specify an alternative installation directory:

```bash
$ DESTDIR="/package/stage" ninja -Cbuild install
```

## Environment Variables

PurC uses the following environment variables for different purposes:

- `PURC_DVOBJS_PATH`: the path to save the shared modules for external dynamic objects.
- `PURC_EXECUTOR_PATH`: the path to save the shared modules for external executors.
- `PURC_FETCHER_EXEC_PATH`: the path to save the executable program of PurC Fetcher.
- `PURC_USER_DIR_SUFFIX`: The directory suffix for the user.
- `PURC_LOG_ENABLE`: `true` if enabling the global log facility.
- `PURC_LOG_SYSLOG`: `true` if enabling to use `syslog` as the log facility.

## Using `purc`

The following sections assume that you have installed PurC to your system,
    and the command line tool `purc` has been installed into `/usr/local/bin/`.
Make sure that you have added `/usr/local/lib` to `/etc/ld.so.conf` and run `sudo ldconfig` command,
     in order that the system can find the shared library of PurC you just installed into `/usr/local/lib`.

### Run a single HVML program

Please save the following contents in a file named `hello.hvml` as your
first HVML program in your working directory:

```hvml
<!DOCTYPE hvml>
<hvml target="void">

    $STREAM.stdout.writelines('Hello, world!')

</hvml>
```

To run this HVML program, you can use `purc` in the following way:

```bash
$ purc hello.hvml
```

You will see that your first HVML program prints `Hello, world!`
on your terminal and quit:

```
Hello, world!
```

You can also run this HVML program directly as a script if you prepend the
following line as the first line in your HVML program:

```
#!/usr/local/bin/purc
```

After this, run the following command to change the mode of the file to have
the executing permission:

```bash
$ chmod +x hello.hvml
```

then run `hello.hvml` directly from the command line:

```bash
$ ./hello.hvml
```

### Run a HVML program with errors or exceptions

Please save the following contents in a file named `error.hvml` in your working directory:

```hvml
<!DOCTYPE hvml>
<hvml target="void">

    $STREAM.stdout.writelines('Hello, world!)

</hvml>
```

We missed the second single quote of `Hello, world!` in the code above.
The interpreter will exit with a nonzero return value if you run `purc` without any options:

```console
$ purc error.hvml
$ echo $?
1
```

You can run `purc` with the option `-v` for a verbose message:

```console
$ purc -v error.hvml
purc 0.9.22

                                             ^
>>>>
```

This time, `purc` reported the error it encountered when it was parsing the HVML program: the wrong line and column (`Position: 3,46`).

If you change the program to add the missing single quote, `purc` will be happy to execute the HVML program.

For an uncaught runtime exception, `purc` will dump the executing stack.

For example, you can save the following program as `exception.hvml`:

```hvml
<!DOCTYPE hvml>
<hvml target="void">
    <iterate on 0 onlyif $L.lt($0<, 10) with $DATA.arith('+', $0<, 1) nosetotail >
        $STREAM.stdout.writelines("$0<) Hello, world! $CRTN.foo")
    </iterate>
</hvml>
```

This HVML program refers to an inexistent property (`foo`) of `$CRTN`.

Run `purc` to execute this HVML program with `-v` option, it will report the executing stack:

```console
$ purc -v exception.hvml

    ^ null
```

### Run multiple HVML programs in parallel

PurC can run multiple HVML programs as coroutines in parallel.

For example, we enhance the first HVML program to print `Hello, world!` 10 times:

```hvml
<!DOCTYPE hvml>
<hvml target="void">
    <iterate on 0 onlyif $L.lt($0<, 10) with $DATA.arith('+', $0<, 1) nosetotail must-yield >
        $STREAM.stdout.writelines(
                $STR.join($0<, ") Hello, world! --from COROUTINE-", $CRTN.cid))
    </iterate>
</hvml>
```

Assume you named the enhanced version as `hello-10.hvml`,
       we can run the program as two coroutines in parallel by specifying the command line flag `-l`:

```bash
$ purc -l hello-10.hvml hello-10.hvml
```

You will see the following output on your terminal:

```
0) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
0) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
1) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
1) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
2) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
2) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
3) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
3) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
4) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
4) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
5) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
5) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
6) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
6) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
7) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
7) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
8) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
8) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
9) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
9) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
```

In the above output, `COROUTINE-3` and `COROUTINE-4` contain the coroutine identifier assigned by PurC for two running instances of the program.
You see that PurC schedules the running instances to execute alternately, i.e., in the manner of coroutines.

If you do not use the flag `-l` in the command line, `purc` will run the programs one by one:

```
$ purc hello-10.hvml hello-10.hvml
0) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
1) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
2) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
3) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
4) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
5) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
6) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
7) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
8) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
9) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-3
0) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
1) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
2) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
3) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
4) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
5) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
6) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
7) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
8) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
9) Hello, world! -- from COROUTINE-4
```

### Connecting to an HVML renderer

One of the important differences between HVML and other programming languages is that HVML can generate documents described in markup languages like HTML,
    not just output data to a file or your terminal.

For your convenience, we have prepared some HVML samples in the directory `Source/Samples/hvml` of this repository.
After building PurC, the samples will be copied to the building root directory, under the `hvml/` subdirectory,
      so that you can change to the building root directory and use `purc` to run the samples.
For example:

```bash
$ cd <path/to/the/building/directory/>
$ purc hvml/fibonacci-void-temp.hvml
```

This HVML program will output 18 Fibonacci numbers less than 2000.
There is also another version of this program: `hvml/fibonacci-html-temp.hvml`.
It will generate an HTML document listing the Fibonacci numbers.

If you run `hvml/fibonacci-html-temp.hvml` program by using `purc` without any option,
   `purc` will use the renderer called `HEADLESS`.
This renderer will record the messages sent by PurC to the renderer in a local file,
     it is `/dev/null` by default on Linux.
Because this HVML program did not use `$STREM.stdout` anymore, you will see nothing on your terminal.
But you can use the option `--verbose` (or the short option `-v`) to show the HTML contents generated by the HVML program in your terminal:

```bash
$ purc -v hvml/fibonacci-html-temp.hvml
```

The command will give you the following output:

```

`purc` now contains a built-in renderer called `Foil`,
    which can show the contents of the target document in your terminal according to CSS properties.
We can use the option `--rdr-comm=thread` (`-c thread` for short) when running `purc` to use the renderer:

```bash
$ purc -c thread hvml/fibonacci-html-temp.hvml
```

Here is the screenshot on macOS:

![Fibonacci Numbers in Foil](/Documents/screenshots/fibonacci-html-temp-foil.png)

You can also try other samples which illustrate the features of the Foil renderer:

- `hvml/foil-layouts.hvml`
- `hvml/foil-progress.hvml`
- `hvml/foil-meter.hvml`

Note that in the current version (0.9.22), Foil is not fully functional.
Shortly, Foil will provide support for most properties of CSS 2.2 and some properties of CSS Level 3,
   so that you can get a similar experience to a web browser.

You can also direct `purc` to connect to a graphics renderer, for example, `xGUI Pro`.
It is an advanced HVML renderer based on WebKit.

Assume that you have installed xGUI Pro on your system,
       you can run `purc` to show the ultimate HTML contents in a window of xGUI Pro.
Please refer to <https://github.com/HVML/xGUI-Pro> for detailed instructions to install xGUI Pro.

Assume that you have started xGUI Pro from another terminal, then please run `purc` with the following options:

```bash
$ purc --rdr-comm=socket hvml/fibonacci-html-temp-rdr.hvml
```

Note that, in the above command line, we execute a modified version of Fibonacci Numbers: `hvml/fibonacci-html-temp-rdr.hvml`.
If you compare these two versions, you will find that there is an `observe` element in the modified version:

```hvml
        <observe on $CRTN for "rdrState:pageClosed">
            <exit with [$count, $last_two] />
        </observe>
```

If there is no such `observe` element, the HVML program will exit immediately after generating the HTML document.
By using the `observe` element, the HVML program will wait for the time when the page created by the renderer is closed by the user (that is you).

You will see that the contents in a window of xGUI Pro created by `hvml/fibonacci-html-temp-rdr.hvml`:

![Fibonacci Numbers](/Documents/screenshots/fibonacci-html-temp.png)

If you close the window by clicking the close box on the caption bar,
   the HVML program will exit as normal.

For a complete HVML program that gives a better experience,
    you can try to run another sample called `hvml/calculator-bc.hvml`, which implements an arbitrary precision calculator:

```bash
$ purc -c socket hvml/calculator-bc.hvml
```

Here is the screenshot of `hvml/calculator-bc.hvml`:

![the Arbitrary Precision Calculator](/Documents/screenshots/calculator-bc.png)

Or run `hvml/planetary-resonance-lines.hvml`, which shows the Planetary Resonance:

```bash
$ purc -c socket hvml/planetary-resonance-lines.hvml
```

Here is the screenshot of `hvml/planetary-resonance-lines.hvml`:

![the Planetary Resonance](/Documents/screenshots/planetary-resonance.png)

For an amazing HVML program that uses multiple coroutines to sieve the prime numbers,
    you can run `hvml/prime-number-sieve.hvml`, which visually illustrates the prime number sieve algorithm:

```bash
$ purc -c socket hvml/prime-number-sieve.hvml
```

Here is the screenshot of `hvml/prime-number-sieve.hvml`:

![the Prime Number Sieve](/Documents/screenshots/prime-number-sieve.png)

For example, to use an external dynamic object defined in a shared library in an HVML program,
    you can run `hvml/file-manager.hvml`, which illustrates the usage of the external dynamic object `$FS`:

```
$ purc -c socket hvml/file-manager.hvml
```

Below is the screenshot of `hvml/file-manager.hvml`:

![the File Manager](/Documents/screenshots/file-manager.png)

Since version 0.9.7, PurC provides support for the Python.
You can now embed Python code in HVML, import Python modules, access the Python variables, or call Python functions directly in your HVML program.
For example, the sample `hvml/embed-python-animated-3d-random-walk.hvml` shows some 3D random animated walks, which are generated by calling NumPy, in a window of xGUI Pro:

```
$ purc -c socket hvml/embed-python-animated-3d-random-walk.hvml
```

Below is the screenshot of this sample:

### Run an HVML app in multiple runners

PurC supports running an app within multiple runners.
Here one `runner` is one thread in the `purc` process.

For this purpose, you can prepare a JSON file or an eJSON file that defines the app, the workspaces, the runners,
    and the initial HVML programs to run as coroutines in different runners.

Here is an example:

```json
{
    "app": "cn.fmsoft.hvml.sample",
    "runners": [
        {
            "name": "Products",
            "renderer": { "comm": "socket", "uri": "unix:///var/tmp/purcmc.sock",
                "workspaceName": "default", "workspaceLayout": "cn.fmsoft.hvml.sample/layout.html" },
            "coroutines": [
                { "url": "hvml/productlist.hvml", "request": {},
                   "renderer": { "pageType": "widget", "pageName": "productlist", "pageGroupId": "theProductsArea" }
                },
                { "url": "hvml/productinfo.hvml", "request": { "productId": 0 },
                   "renderer": { "pageType": "widget", "pageName": "productinfo", "pageGroupId": "theProductsArea" }
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Customers",
            "renderer": { "comm": "socket", "uri": "unix:///var/tmp/purcmc.sock",
                "workspaceName": "default", "workspaceLayout": "cn.fmsoft.hvml.sample/layout.html" },
            "coroutines": [
                { "url": "hvml/customerlist.hvml", "request": {},
                   "renderer": { "pageType": "widget", "pageName": "customerlist", "pageGroupId": "theCustomersArea" }
                },
                { "url": "hvml/customerlist.hvml", "request": { "customerId": 0 },
                   "renderer": { "pageType": "widget", "pageName": "customerinfo", "pageGroupId": "theCustomersArea" }
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Daemons",
            "coroutines": [
                { "url": "hvml/check-customers.hvml", "request": { "interval": 10 } },
                { "url": "hvml/check-products.hvml", "request": { "interval": 30 } }
            ]
        },
    ]
}
```

Assume that you prepare all HVML programs and save the above JSON as `cn.fmsoft.hvml.sample.json`,
       you can run `purc` in the following way:

```bash
$ purc cn.fmsoft.hvml.sample.json
```

Note that, when running an app in this way,
     you can use the command line options in the eJSON file through the variable `$OPTS` prepared by `purc` when parsing the eJSON file.
This gives a typical application of parameterized eJSON introduced by PurC.

For example, we can specify the command line options:

```bash
$ purc --app=cn.fmsoft.hvml.sample my_app.ejson
```

Then use the option specified by `--app` in `my_app.ejson`:

```json
{
    "app": "$OPTS.app",
    "runners": [
        {
            "name": "Products",
            "renderer": { "comm": "socket", "uri": "unix:///var/tmp/purcmc.sock",
                "workspaceName": "default", "workspaceLayout": "$OPTS.app/layout.html" },
            "coroutines": [
                { "url": "cn.fmsoft.hvml.sample/productlist.hvml", "request": {},
                   "renderer": { "pageType": "widget", "pageName": "productlist", "pageGroupId": "theProductsArea" }
                },
                { "url": "cn.fmsoft.hvml.sample/productinfo.hvml", "request": { "productId": 0 },
                   "renderer": { "pageType": "widget", "pageName": "productinfo", "pageGroupId": "theProductsArea" }
                },
            ]
        },
    ]
}
```

All occurrences of `$OPTS.app` in `my_app.ejson` will be substituted by `cn.fmsoft.hvml.sample`.

### More HVML samples

You can find more HVML sample programs in the repository [HVML Documents](https://github.com/HVML/hvml-docs),
    under the directory `samples/`.

You can use `purc` to run a sample resided in the remote HVML Documents repository directly:

```bash
$ purc --data-fetcher=remote https://github.com/HVML/hvml-docs/raw/master/samples/fibonacci/fibonacci-6.hvml
```

If the firewall refused to connect to the URL, use the following URL:

```bash
$ purc --data-fetcher=remote https://gitlab.fmsoft.cn/hvml/hvml-docs/-/raw/master/samples/fibonacci/fibonacci-6.hvml
```

Note that when `purc` try to load an HVML program from a remote URL,
     it will use the remote data fetcher by default.
Since 0.9.0, PurC Fetcher had been included in this repository, and it will be built along with PurC.

### Current Status

This project was launched in June. 2021, and we opened this repo in July 2022.
This is version 0.9.22 of PurC.

The main purpose of PurC is to provide a library for you to write your own HVML interpreter.
The current version implements almost all features defined by [HVML Specification V1.0],
      and also implements almost all predefined dynamic variables defined by [HVML Predefined Variables V1.0].
We plan to release PurC version 1.0 in Dec. 2025.

Except for the HVML interpreter, PurC also provides many fundamental features for general C programs:

1. PurC provides the APIs for variant management, here variant is the way HVML manages data.
1. PurC provides the APIs for parsing JSON and extended JSON.
1. PurC provides the APIs for parsing and evaluating a parameterized Hybrid Evalution Expression (HEE).
1. PurC provides the APIs for parsing an HTML document.
1. PurC provides the APIs for creating multiple HVML runners.
1. PurC provides the APIs for parsing an HVML program and scheduling to run it.

You can use these groups of APIs independently according to your needs.

### Source Tree of PurC

PurC implements the parser, the interpreter, and some built-in dynamic variant
objects for HVML. It is mainly written in C/C++ language and will provide bindings
