/* The LRU supports a global cache shared between multiple domains and multiple
 * versions of their datasets. The purpose is not to have to flush the whole
 * LRU once a key is updated and not valid anymore (eg: ACL files), as well as
 * to reliably support concurrent accesses and handle conflicts gracefully. For
 * each key a pointer to a dataset and its internal data revision are stored.
 * All lookups verify that these elements match those passed by the caller and
 * only return a valid entry upon matching. Otherwise the entry is either
 * allocated or recycled and considered new. New entries are always initialized
 * with a NULL domain pointer which is used by the caller to detect that the
 * entry is new and must be populated. Such entries never expire and are
 * protected from the risk of being recycled. It's then the caller's
 * responsibility to perform the operation and commit the entry with its latest
 * result. This domain thus serves as a lock to protect the entry during all
 * the computation needed to update it. In a simple use case where the cache is
 * dedicated, it is recommended to pass the LRU head as the domain pointer and
 * for example zero as the revision. The most common use case for the caller
 * consists in simply checking that the return is not null and that the domain
 * is not null, then to use the result. The get() function returns null if it
 * cannot allocate a node (memory or key being currently updated).
